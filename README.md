# To demonstrate Python packaging

1. This is a project called math-tool. It contains multiple modules:                

    * A calculator module (src/lib/calculator.py) for basic arithmetic
    * A statistics module (src/lib/statistics.py) for statistical calculations

2. Include tests for each module in the tests/ directory.

3. Provide a CLI interface (main.py) for interacting with users.

4. Uses pyproject.toml for packaging.                                                                                                                                     

## Step 1: Implement the module

1.1 Write functions for calculator module.

1.2 Write functions of statistics module.

1.3 Write code in main.py. 

## Step 2: Write tests

2.1 Tests for calculator.py 

2.2 Tests for statistics.py

## Step 3: Add a `pyproject.toml`

## Step 4: Add a Makefile
